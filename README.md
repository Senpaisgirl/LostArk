Hi All,

I've created a little calculator and optimizer for allocating your astrogems for Relic and Ancient Cores.

This Calculator is intended to be used as a way to ease your selection and eliminate the need to manually figuring out the best combination of your available Astrogems to fit into three different Core slots, while maximizing points and staying within strict Willpower limits.

As of now this calculator doesn't take into account the side node - it only focuses on Willpower & Points.

Please if you have any feedback or find bugs let me know, and if you are able to enhance this further, the Open source code is available.

Thank You All
